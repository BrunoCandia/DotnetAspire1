## Demo data

The data and service used for this tutorial comes from the United States National Weather Service (NWS) at https://weather.gov  We are using their OpenAPI specification to query weather forecasts.  The OpenAPI specification is [available online](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api).  We are using only 2 methods of this API, and simplified our code to just use those methods instead of creating the entire OpenAPI client for the NWS API.
